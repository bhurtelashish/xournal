* This is next branch  of Xournal

This repository is to host features of xournal that are considered
stable enough for further distribution but are not part of the official xournal.

It should *not be used* for code intended for further distribution.

See https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/blob/master/README.org for an
explanation of the development model of xournal, and the role of this
branch

* Currently integrated branches not in upstream

- touchscreen-as-hand-tool: Use the touchscreen as a handtool exclusively
- horizontal-scroll-lock: do not allow hand tool to scroll horizontally
- fixes an inconsistency of g_path_get_basename when trying to open
  the PDF in the background: in windows it is capable of dealing with linux
  paths, but not in linux. Now it is symmetric.
